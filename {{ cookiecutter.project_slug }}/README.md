# {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}

Hi there! ðŸ˜„ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for using BeanHub, and congratulations on creating your first BeanHub repository.
There are many things you can do with BeanHub.

## Getting started

First, to clone your repository locally, you can create an access token set with proper Git operation permissions on the [access token management page](https://app.beanhub.io/access-tokens).
Next, You can clone your repository locally by running:

```bash
git clone https://app.beanhub.io/repos/{{ cookiecutter.username }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}.git
```

The username is `{{ cookiecutter.username }}` as your BeanHub account, and the password should be the access token's secret key value.

You can modify your accounting book locally, commit and push it to BeanHub. See what happens:

```bash
git push
```

After you push your changes to BeanHub, you can refresh the web pages of your BeanHub repository to see the up-to-date accounting book data.
BeanHub is more than just a hosted Beancount based on Git.
Let's see what else you can achieve with it!

## Import

Importing data from various sources, such as your bank or credit card accounts, is one major pain point of using plain-text accounting books like Beancount.
We made it easier than ever for you to import various sources with rule-based automation.
We have already provided you a sample import rules file at [.beanhub/imports.yaml](/repos/{{ cookiecutter.username }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/blob/master/.beanhub/imports.yaml) in this repository.

You can download this [sample CSV file here](https://github.com/LaunchPlatform/beanhub-beancount-cookiecutter/blob/fec70afb34de161f9807442c89a523f626bd2f0a/assets/beanhub-import-sample.csv).
To upload and import it, click the **Import** button on the left-hand side menu and then click **Upload Files**.
Or you can [click here](/repos/{{ cookiecutter.username }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/import/upload-files/master).

Then, choose the CSV file you downloaded and press the upload button.
After that, you will need to review the uploaded file.
Press the **Import** button, and here you go!

You just imported transactions from the bank account CSV file with a few clicks!

## Forms

Input repetitive transactions manually are time-consuming and error-prone.
BeanHub allows you to define your custom forms for generating transactions.
We have already provided a sample form for you in the [.beanhub/forms.yaml file](/repos/{{ cookiecutter.username }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/blob/master/.beanhub/forms.yaml).
You can try it out by clicking the **Forms** button on the left-hand side menu, then clicking the form **Hours spent on XYZ contracting project**, or simply [clicking here](/repos/{{ cookiecutter.username }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/form/add-xyz-hours).

After you submit the form, a new transaction will be added in a Git commit based on your input.

## API Access

Have you ever wondered how cool it would be if you could read and write your Beancount accounting book with a well-defined API?
You are in luck.
BeanHub provides a featureful API that allows you to access your accounting books.
With this API, you can insert, update, or delete entries programmatically.
You can read the [API documents here](https://api.beanhub.io/redoc).
To access the API, you need to create an access token on the access token management page here.

Please read our blog article [New API access feature for reading and writing Beancount data easily](https://beanhub.io/blog/2023/08/28/announcement-of-the-new-api-feature/) to learn more about it.
