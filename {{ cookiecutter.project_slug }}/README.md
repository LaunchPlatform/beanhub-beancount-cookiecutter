Hi there! ðŸ˜„ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for using BeanHub, and congratulations on creating your first BeanHub repository.
There are many things you can do with BeanHub.

## Getting started

First, to clone your repository locally, you can create an access token set with proper Git operation permissions on the [access token management page](https://app.beanhub.io/access-tokens).
Next, You can clone your repository locally by running:

```bash
git clone https://app.beanhub.io/repos/{{ cookiecutter.username }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}.git
```

The username is `{{ cookiecutter.username }}` as your BeanHub account, and the password should be the access token's secret key value.

You can modify your accounting book locally, commit and push it to BeanHub. See what happens:

```bash
git push
```

After you push your changes to BeanHub, you can refresh the web pages of your BeanHub repository to see the up-to-date accounting book data.
BeanHub is more than just a hosted Beancount based on Git.
Let's see what else you can achieve with it!

## Forms

Input repetitive transactions manually are time-consuming and error-prone.
BeanHub allows you to define your custom forms for generating transactions.
You can try it out by clicking the **Forms** button on the left-hand side menu, then clicking the form **Hours spent on XYZ contracting project**, or simply [clicking here](/repos/{{ cookiecutter.username }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/form/add-xyz-hours).

After you submit the form, a new transaction will be inserted based on your input.
