Hi there!

Thank you for using BeanHub, and congratulations on creating your first BeanHub repository.
There are many things you can do with BeanHub.

## Getting started

First, to clone your repository locally, you can create an access token set with proper Git operation permissions on the access token management page.
Next, You can clone your repository locally by running:

```bash
git clone FIXME
```

The username is the same as the one you used for your BeanHub account, and the password should be the access token's secret key value.

You can modify your accounting book locally and push it to BeanHub. See what happens:

```bash
git push
```

After you push your changes to BeanHub, you can refresh the web pages of your BeanHub repository to see the up-to-date accounting book data. BeanHub is more than just a hosted Beancount based on Git. Let's see what else you can achieve with it!

## Forms

You can try it out by clicking the "Forms" button on the left-hand side menu, then clicking the form "FIXME," or simply clicking here.
